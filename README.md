# Cat wiki app built with
- Vite
- React
- Typescript
- Tailwindcss
- Express
- Cat wiki rest api _link here_

## How I worked on this project
- I built the app using figma designs from devChallenges.io _link here_
- I used the user stories from the challenges

## How to navigate this project
- This application fetches data from the cat api. Examples for _the request_ and _data transformation_

## Why I built the project this way
- This is to reinforce and practise my data fetching skills using express js and serving the code to the backend
- I did not use a state management library. Places where I needed global state, I used react context hook
- This is more focused on the frontend but my plan is to continue practising and developing both my frontend and backend skills.

## Libraries used
### Frontend
- React router: I used this to create the dynamic pages when users click on a cat to see more information
- 
### Backend
- Axios: I used axios to handle my get requests.

## If I had more time
- Build and deploy my own api
- Refactor some of the code. Especially this part

## Available scripts
In the project directory you can run:

`npm install && npm run server && cd client && npm install && npm run dev`

That will install all the necessary dependancies and start the server and client.
